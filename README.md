📌 Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 4

Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data (Google Colab)

As part of my Oasis Infobyte internship, I completed Task 4: Sentiment Analysis, where I analyzed tweets to understand public opinions and emotional tones. The project aimed to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments to help businesses and organizations track audience perception.

🔍 Project Steps:

1️⃣ Imported and explored the dataset in Google Colab.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning – Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, numbers, and special characters.
3️⃣ Text Preprocessing – Tokenized words, removed stopwords, and applied lemmatization using NLTK.
4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Checked sentiment distribution, trending keywords, and frequently used hashtags.
5️⃣ Sentiment Classification – Used TextBlob polarity scoring for sentiment detection.
6️⃣ Data Visualization – Plotted bar charts, pie charts, and WordClouds for better insight representation.
7️⃣ Summarized insights and patterns observed in the data.

💡 Key Insights:

Identified the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.

Discovered trending keywords linked to sentiment variations.

Provided a clear picture of audience mood towards topics.
